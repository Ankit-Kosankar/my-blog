  <WorksWith></WorksWith>

  <p>
    I have around 3 years of professional experience, primarily focused on backend system design and development. I specialize in building scalable, maintainable REST APIs using a microservices architecture. While backend is my strong suit, I‚Äôm also comfortable working across the stack to deliver complete, production-ready features.
  </p>

  <p>
    üí° What sets me apart is a systems-thinking mindset, attention to clean architecture, and a strong focus on writing well-tested, maintainable code. I thrive in collaborative environments that value problem-solving, architecture discussions, and continuous improvement.
  </p>

  <p>
    I genuinely believe being a developer today is both exciting and overwhelming ‚Äî with the rapid pace of AI and tech evolution, implementation has become easier, but deep learning is often skipped. I try to slow things down, reflect, and truly understand what I build. "Vibe coding" is fun, but what really matters is building solid, meaningful software.
  </p>

  <p>
	I love breaking down complex concepts, experimenting with tools, and vibing with code. With AI speeding things up, it‚Äôs tempting to just build fast ‚Äî but I still enjoy diving deep and understanding what‚Äôs really going on under the hood. This blog is where I share what I learn, think, and occasionally just random ideas outside of tech.

    üî≠ Currently, I'm diving deeper into:
    <ul>
      <li>Distributed Systems & Event-Driven Architecture</li>
      <li>Cloud Infrastructure (AWS, GCP)</li>

    This blog is my personal space to share what I learn, build, and think. Expect deep dives into system design, dev tips, thoughts on new tools ‚Äî and occasionally, some completely random but interesting topics. I explore things beyond my day job, and I enjoy writing about them too.

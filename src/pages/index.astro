					<h1>üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Hi,I am Ankit!</h1>
					<p>
						I'm a software engineer driven by curiosity and obsessed with how things work under the hood.
						who has builder's mindset and a deep love for clean, scalable systems. I've spend last
						few year working on backend systems and some time on
						fronted designing robust ui.
					</p>
					<p>
						Over the past few years, I‚Äôve spent my time designing
						both microservices-based architectures and robust
						monolithic systems ‚Äî mostly for financial domains where
						performance, consistency, and reliability matter most.
						<code>astro.config.mjs</code><a
							href="https://astro.build/integrations"></a>
					</p>
					<p>
						What excites me is solving real-world problems with
						elegant engineering ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs optimizing
						inter-service communication, fine-tuning a PostgreSQL
						query, or containerizing systems for smoother
						deployment. I enjoy thinking in systems, not just
						services.
					</p>
					Beyond just code, I love sharing what I learn ‚Äî be it through
					writing, mentoring, or open discussion. I believe great software
					comes from collaboration, curiosity, and craftsmanship.
					<p>
						Have fun! If you get stuck, remember to
						<a href="https://docs.astro.build/">read the docs</a>

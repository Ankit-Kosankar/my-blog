## Let’s Understand What is Hashing


Hashing is simple. Suppose you have some data—a character, a number, a word—and you convert it into a special code called a **hash**. Every time you hash the same thing, you get **the same code**.

Why does this matter? Because it helps us **find things quickly** in programming, especially when we are solving problems where we need to **count, check, or map things**.

---

## Why Hashing is Useful
Hashing is very handy in many problems. For example:

- **Character Frequency:** Count how many times `'a'` comes in `"banana"`.
- **Anagram Check:** Is `"nasa"` an anagram of `"sana"`?
- **Duplicate Elements:** Check if the same number comes more than once in an array.
- **Unique Elements:** Find the numbers that appear only once.
- **Majority Element:** Find the number that occurs the most.
- **Two-Sum Problem:** Find two numbers whose sum is equal to a target.

Basically, if you want to **count, check existence, or quickly find things**, hashing is your friend.

---

## When Should You Use a HashMap?
Think of **HashMap** as a quick way to store and look up things. Use it when you want to:

- Count frequencies 
- Check duplicates 
- Check if something exists 
- Map things together 
- Store already calculated results (caching/memoization) 

And the best part? All these operations happen **very fast**, almost constant time on average.

So next time you see a problem like “count this” or “check that,” your brain should immediately think: **“Its Time For Hashmap!”** 

---

## Patterns You Should Know
HashMaps are very useful in certain patterns:

- **Frequency Map Pattern:** Count how many times each element comes.
- **Two-Sum Pattern:** Find pairs that add up to a target.
- **Prefix/Suffix Sum Patterns:** Useful in subarray problems.
- **Existence Check:** Quickly check if something is already there.
- **Caching / Memoization:** Store results and reuse.
- **Grouping:** Group elements based on some property.
- **Frequency Distribution:** Who appears how many times.

Master these, and most HashMap problems will become easy.

### Basic Operations
```java
map.put("key", value);                  // Add or update
Integer value = map.get("key");         // Get value
Integer removed = map.remove("key");    // Remove key
map.putIfAbsent("key", value);          // Add if not already there
map.replace("key", value);              // Replace value
boolean updated = map.replace("key", oldValue, newValue); // Replace only if value matches
```

#### Checking Methods

```java
boolean exists = map.containsKey("key"); // Is key present?
boolean isEmpty = map.isEmpty();         // Is map empty?
int size = map.size();                   // How many entries?```

#### Iteration :

```java
Set<String> keys = map.keySet();                        // All keys
Set<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> entries = map.entrySet(); // Key-value pairs
```

#### Functional Updates :

```java
map.compute("key", (k, v) -> v == null ? 1 : v + 1);   // Compute and update
map.computeIfAbsent("key", k -> 10);                   // Insert if absent
map.computeIfPresent("key", (k, v) -> v + 1);         // Update if present
```

#### Advanced Utilities

```java
Integer value = map.getOrDefault("key", 0); // Get value or default
map.clear();                                // Remove all entries
```

Wrapping Up
Hashing and HashMaps are super useful tools. Once you understand them and practice common patterns, problems that looked tough will start feeling easy.
